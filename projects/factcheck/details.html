            Social media sites have created a perfect breeding ground for misinformation to spread faster than ever. Due to artificially intelligent bots, “trolls” who intentionally spread fake news, as well as personalized and microtargeted ads, it’s too easy for the average user of social media to access and buy into the misinformed claims.

            Fact checking claims with reliable information from sources of credible information is the best way to combat the spread of misinformation. Fackcheckr.io is a website which allows users to input claims or links to articles and see how truthful they are.
